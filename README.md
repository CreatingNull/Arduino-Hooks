# ![NullTek Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CreatingNull/NullTek-Assets/main/img/logo/NullTekDocumentationLogo.png) Pre-Commit Arduino Hooks

[![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)

This project provides [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) hooks for [official arduino](https://github.com/arduino) command line tooling. 

Currently this includes:

* [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) - Multi-purpose tool, in this context is often used to verify your arduino code is able to be compiled.
* [arduino-lint](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-lint) - Linter for checking arduino projects for problems and conventions.

This project uses the Command class from poccs [clinters](https://github.com/pocc/pre-commit-hooks), to handle most of the cross-platform, sub-process nastiness.
